**Here is the respawn mechanism:**

When mod first installs, it will calculate the amounts of these respawnable things and save it. As we playing the game, it will compare the current amounts of these things with the amounts that saved before. And if the current amount is less, the world will spawn the thing. If the current amount is more that the origin, it will stop regrowth, which makes the world maintain the same as the origin.

With the mod, your server will never flood with too many stuffs.
